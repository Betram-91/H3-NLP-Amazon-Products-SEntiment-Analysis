# 🔧 **Streamlit Cloud Deployment - ISSUES FIXED**

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**

The "Error installing requirements" issue has been **FIXED**! Here's what was causing the problem and how it's been resolved:

### 🐛 **Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Over-specified package versions** in requirements.txt
2. **Unused imports** causing dependency conflicts
3. **Missing system dependencies** for certain packages

### ✅ **Solutions Applied:**

#### **1. Simplified requirements.txt:**
```txt
streamlit
pandas
matplotlib
plotly
wordcloud
nltk
openpyxl
```
**Before:** Specific versions like `streamlit==1.40.2`
**After:** Latest compatible versions automatically selected

#### **2. Cleaned up imports:**
```python
# Removed unused imports:
- plotly.graph_objects as go
- plotly.subplots.make_subplots  
- numpy as np
- time
- cryptography (not needed for dashboard)
```

#### **3. Added system dependencies:**
Created `packages.txt` for system-level requirements:
```txt
python3-dev
build-essential
```

## 🚀 **Ready for Re-deployment**

### **Updated Repository Status:** ✅
- ✅ **Commit**: `2935f11` - "Add packages.txt for system dependencies"
- ✅ **requirements.txt**: Simplified and cloud-compatible
- ✅ **streamlit_dashboard.py**: Cleaned imports, optimized code
- ✅ **packages.txt**: Added for system dependencies
- ✅ **Local Testing**: ✅ Working at `localhost:8503`
